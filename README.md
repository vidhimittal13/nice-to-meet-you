# Nice To Meet You

Nice To Meet You is a simple web app designed to keep track of the details of people you meet during networking sessions, tech conferences, and other professional gatherings. This project was inspired by my experiences at the Grace Hopper Celebration and many other tech events, where you get to meet so many new people and have interesting conversations.

However, it's often a challenge to remember all the details about each new acquaintance, especially when you want to reach out to them later via LinkedIn or other social platforms with a personalized note. Nice To Meet You aims to solve this problem by allowing users to quickly input basic details and memorable conversation pointers about each new contact.

## Features

- Record basic information of new contacts (Name, Organization, Contact info etc.)
- Add memorable conversation pointers or notes about each person
- Built using HTML, PHP, MySQL
- Simple, clean, and user-friendly interface

## Project Status

This project is currently in a very basic state, a foundation upon which I plan to build a robust and full-featured application.
